/*
       Test Three:  a special sample of five points
       
       This is a modified "W-example" from Section 5.13 of the book by Nikolai Chernov:
       "Circular and linear regression: Fitting circles and lines by least squares"
       Chapman & Hall/CRC, Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability, volume 117, 2010.
       
       In this example, the algebraic fit by Taubin mistakenly places 
       the initial circle on the "wrong side" of the sample 
       (in fact, most algebraic fits do the same in this example).
       
       As a result, both versions of the standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
       move the fitting circle in the wrong direction and diverge.
       
       Chernov-Lesort and Chernov-Houssam methods, designed to converge 
       from any initial circle, flip the fitting circle to the "right side" 
       of the sample and find the best fitting circle
          
          Correct answers:
          
       Taubin fit should give 
       center (0.0,1237.1)  radius 1237.  sigma  1.09612
          
       The best fitting circle is 
       center (0.0,-3283.3)  radius 3283.3  
       
       sigma computed by a standard, numerically unstable formula is 1.09579
       sigma computed by a special,  numerically stable   formula is 1.20075
